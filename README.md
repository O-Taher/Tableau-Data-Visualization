# Tableau-Data-Visualization
The Reframing Happiness project explored the complex relationship between national well-being indicators and socioeconomic variables. Our diverse international group analyzed open data from the World Happiness Report spanning 2015-2019. We utilized the dynamic visualization platform Tableau to interactively explore the multidimensional connections between GDP, social support networks, life evaluations, generosity, and perceived corruption to better understand national happiness rankings.

Tableau allowed us to rapidly prototype various visualizations like scatter plots, chloropleth maps, and trend lines to identify both expected and unexpected patterns in the data. For example, we created interactive maps that revealed family ties had an outsized impact on happiness in some regions, even compared to economic growth alone. Dynamic filters and tooltips in Tableau also helped us gain valuable insights.

Through statistical modeling and these interactive Tableau dashboards, we pinpointed relationships that may have been overlooked with static reports. We found while economic growth significantly correlated with well-being globally, other factors like health, freedom and good governance contributed greatly on a national level. Both monetary and non-monetary influences together shape lives and societies in complex, place-dependent ways.
